# Custom Fileupload

So this is a little script to fully customize the file input element w/ jQuery.

Include the JS file and the CSS file in your app, and then call  

` $('jquery-selector').customFile({ status:true, text: 'Choose File', root:'p' });  `

` status - a boolean of whether or not to show status on select`  
` text - the text to display`  
` root - the root element to replace the input with`  

The code is pretty easy to follow.
